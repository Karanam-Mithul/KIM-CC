The dataset used in this project was created entirely by me using web scraping with BeautifulSoup. Since IPO data across different financial portals was inconsistent and scattered, I built a custom scraping workflow to extract details such as company name, issue size, price band, listing price, subscription data, and listing gains. The scraper fetched data from multiple trusted sources, after which I cleaned and standardized the fields to maintain uniformity. I also implemented logic to handle missing values, irregular formats, and duplicate entries that often appear across financial websites. After merging and validating all scraped information, I compiled a final dataset of 561 IPOs spanning January 2010 to August 2025, which serves as the foundation for the exploratory data analysis in this project.
